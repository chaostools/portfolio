## **Baseball Pitch Prediction**
Using various machine learning methods, I was able to predict the next pitch of an at-bat with up to 75% accuracy. Check out the blog post [here](blog/doYouReallyNeedTrashCans.md)

## **pyTigerGraph**
A Python package that interfaces with a TigerGraph database's REST API. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/parkererickson/pytigergraph).

## **AI Racing League**
Created and tested a variety of computer vision algorithms to autonomously control an RC Car. Also teach AI concepts to kids at CoderDojo.

## **IPO Prediction using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks**
Used TigerGraph Cloud, Gradle, and pyTigerGraph to predict companies that would IPO using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. Check out the blog post [here](blog/ipoGCN.md)

## **@mlstyletransfer**
A Twitter bot that uses machine learning to transfer a certain style of art onto an user-provided photo. Hosted on AWS services.  Uses Keras, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS.  The code for the style transfer is [here](https://github.com/parkererickson/MLSPstyletransfer).  The code that handles collecting the tweets and inserting them into the database is [here](https://github.com/parkererickson/MLSPtweetstream).  Want to check out some of the results?
